# payload-generator
A simple payload generator for learning web vulnerabilities (e.g. XSS). Intended for ethical hacking and educational use only.

This repository contains a simple **Payload Generator** tool designed for educational use in learning about basic web security testing and input sanitization issues (e.g., XSS). The tool helps generate different types of payloads for common web vulnerability testing scenarios.

# Features

- Generate payloads for:
  - Reflected XSS
  - SQL Injection (SQLi)
- Basic web interface using Flask
- Easy to extend for more payload types

# Requirements

- Python 3.7 or higher
- No external libraries required

---

# Possible Improvements

- Add more payload categories such as CSRF, Command Injection, or SSTI
- Support custom user-defined payloads via JSON or CLI input
- Enable context-aware encoding for HTML, JavaScript, or URL injection points
- Export payload sets to JSON or CSV for easier reuse or sharing
- Add colored CLI output and interactive menus for better UX
- Integrate into a web interface using Flask or Streamlit for non-CLI users
- Provide payload metadata (e.g. risk level, context, notes) for documentation

---

# Use Cases

- Learning scripting and input-based attack vectors for cybersecurity beginners
- Practicing XSS and SQLi exploitation in labs or CTFs
- Building reusable payload sets for penetration testing workflows
- Teaching encoding, sanitization, and injection logic in security courses
- Generating quick test inputs during web app fuzzing or validation testing
